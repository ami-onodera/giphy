# Giphy "copycat" website

This was my final project from the JavaScript course at *ReDi School* in Berlin, and proudly voted to represent my class at the Demo Day!

In this project I used the Giphy API to develop a simplified version of [Giphy](http://www.giphy.com) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br>
