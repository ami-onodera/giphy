# Giphy "copycat" website

This was my final project from the JavaScript course at ReDi School in Berlin, and proudly voted to represent my class at the Demo Day!

In this project I used the Giphy API to develop a simplified version of [Giphy](http://www.giphy.com) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br>
